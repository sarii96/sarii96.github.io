           <h1>Soda Springs</h1>
       <img src="images/sodasprings.jpg" atl="town">
       <p>Soda Springs is a city in Caribou County, Idaho, United States. Its population was 3,058 at the 2010 census.<br>
         The city has been the county seat of Caribou County since the county was organized in 1919. In the 1860s, Soda Springs served as the seat of Oneida County.</p>
         <p><strong>History</strong></p>
         <p>
            The city is named for the hundreds of natural springs of carbonated water that are located in and around the city.The springs were well known to Native Americans<br>
             and were a famous landmark along the Oregon Trail in the middle 19th century. Today the city is also known as the location of the Soda Springs Geyser, which was<br>
             unleashed in 1934 when "town fathers" were looking for hot water for a "hot pool" bathing attraction. Instead they drilled into a chamber of highly pressurized<br>
             carbon dioxide gas and cold water and the geyser was released. After running for weeks, and flooding the downtown area, it was capped and manually released when requested as a tourist attraction. <br>
             Now it is let loose every hour on the hour by a timed release valve. Its height and volume have not decreased after many years. There are viewing platforms at either end of the travertine mound<br>
             where the geyser erupts. Interpretive signs are located on the platforms explaining this phenomenon.<br>
             Soda Springs is also the location of one of the Ground Observer Corps sites.
